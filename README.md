ev-CIVIL: Event-Based Dataset for Visual Detection of Civil Infrastructure Defects and Benchmark

Here is the archived version of our journal paper which is under review. The paper contains the link to the dataset which contain both events and frames captured simultaneously under different lighting conditions.
If you found our data/paper/code important or useful please cite our paper. Thank you !!!

* For detection benchmarking,
    - YOLOv6 model was developed based on the initial code from https://github.com/meituan/YOLOv6
    - SSD model was developed based on the initial code from https://github.com/vietnh1009/SSD-pytorch


Here are some visualization of the labelling of selected samples from field data.



 1. Day time data samples

**spalling - event-based**
